Currently, I have compiled 177 pages of notes on Linux for personal use (much of which were borrowed verbatim from the [Linux Shell Handbook - 2021 Edition](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Resources/Special-Editions/41-Linux-Shell-Handbook-2021-Edition)) on my website at [Linux Notes](https://corystephenson.github.io/media/Linux%20Notes.pdf).
